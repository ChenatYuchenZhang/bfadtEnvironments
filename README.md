Themes 
	•	interactive spaces
	•	immersive environments
	•	interdependency
	•	body as medium
	•	space as laboratory
	•	multiple sensory experiences

How
	•	networked interfaces
	•	multi-screen displays
	•	data structures/visualization
	•	hardware/software

Deliverables 
Weekly demos introduce students to new forms & processes for the first 6 weeks.  The remaining time will support students work toward a shared final project to critique, advice & troubleshoot student works.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of the semester, students will be able to:

1.  Demonstrate an understanding of spatial contexts as they affect interactive media relative to physical scale. (IE: small installations to immersive environments)
2. Expand their creative vocabulary in the design and creation of dynamic/interactive works, using new forms/processes/materials. 
3. Develop a range of methods for the expression and articulation of ideas, including experimentation, information gathering, testing and refinement. 

4. Articulate their thoughts, both in their own design process and in critical feedback to others. 
5. Implement a final interactive project that integrates spatial or environmental themes in the class towards their own creative practice.
